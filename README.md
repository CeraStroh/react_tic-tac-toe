# react_tic-tac-toe

I followed along with the React.js [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) at reactjs.org.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

This app:
* Lets users play tic-tac-toe
* Indicates when a player has won the game
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board


### `npm install`
All dependencies in the app must be installed first.

### `npm start`
Start the app on http://localhost3000
